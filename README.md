## Setup
For working on the contents of the notes, install [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Open up the `/content` folder in this repo in obsidian so that you don't include the `/site` folder.
For building the site locally, install [hugo-obsidian](https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian#obsidian-link-scraper) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

## Running Locally
```shell
cd site
make serve
```

## Site format
Check out these [example pages](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo/content) for examples on how to format content in the markdown pages. The heading uses frontmatter for including metadata about a page.
