Hashing is a super neat example of cryptography, with many important uses in data integrity. The algorithm used when hashing takes any input data (known as the plaintext) - such as a message, a file, a password - and produces a fixed size ciphertext; which is a hash value, most commonly referred to has a hash.</description></item><item><title>Linux Intro</title><link>https://wiki.xctf.io/linux/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.xctf.io/linux/intro/</guid><description>What is Linux?
